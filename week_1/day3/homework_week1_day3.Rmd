This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}

```{r}
movies <- read_csv("/Users/user/Documents/CodeClan/de13_classnotes/week_01/day_3/6_homework_cleaning_data/data/movies.csv")
```

```{r}
head(movies)
```
# the difference betwewen title and original title?
# how's the popularity been calculated
# a function to compare two colummns to choose between titile and original_title?

```
```{r}

  summarise(count = sum(is.na(title)))

movies_selected %>%

# combine those in one?
```
```{r}

  mutate(runtime = na_if(runtime, 0))
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
movies_imputed <- movies_runtime %>%
  mutate(runtime = coalesce(runtime, median(runtime, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```{r}

  summarise(count = sum(is.na(runtime)))
```

```{r}

movies_imputed %>%
  mutate(budget == if_else(budget < 100,
                          median(budget)))
```
